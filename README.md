# Employee-Exit-Survey-Analysis

Context: 

I was asked to create this Tableau report and analysis to to ascertain the reasons why people in my company decide to leave their jobs. It was helpful
and beneficial for my company to understand the various issues that led to employee resignation and terminations. This report, visualied in Tableau, ultimately 
helped my company identify and then rectify the issues that led to employee resignations. 

Somme of the departments that used this report included:
- Human Resources: this report helped them gauge employee sentimment about a variety of subjects including employee benefits, compensation, career advancement
and relationships with managers. 
- Employee recruitment teams: the analysis helped them direct their interview questions
- Team Finance: the analyis helped them allocate funds to different segments of our company to address employee retention.
