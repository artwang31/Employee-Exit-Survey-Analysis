# Employee-Exit-Survey-Analysis

** PERSONAL AND/OR UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM ALL SAMPLE DATA ** 

Goal and Purpose:

Before this analysis my company did not have a centralized way to gather and visualize reasons why employees left the company. Therefore,
I was asked to create this Tableau report and analysis to visualize these reasons as it is helpful and beneficial for my company to understand the various 
issues that led to employee resignation and terminations. 

Context: 

This report, visualied in Tableau, ultimately helped my company identify and then rectify the issues that led to employee resignations. 

Some of the departments that used this report included:
    - Human Resources: this report helped them gauge employee sentimment about a variety of subjects including employee benefits, compensation, career advancement
and relationships with managers. 
    - Employee recruitment teams: the analysis helped them direct their interview questions
    - Team Finance: the analyis helped them allocate funds to different segments of our company to address employee retention.

Methodology:

I wanted this analysis to be as comprehensive as possible as this would be the last time we as a company could ever gather data and information about the employee.
Therefore, I created an extensive Exit Survey in Qualtrics to mine this data. The survey questions asked the leaving employee about all aspects of their time with
the company. Some subjects included:
   - Why they are leaving?
   - What they thought of the company?
   - Their impressions about their manager and colleagues?
   - Whether company benefits (health, vision, dependency) were adequate.
   - Whether they'd ever work with the company again and why?
   - Etc.

Once I effectively gathered the data in Qualtrics, I then cleaned the data and pivoted the data in ways that would best be visualized in Tableau.

Final Report:

The final report had many visualizations, three of which are shareable because they include no unique identifers and respects the data privacy and integrity of all people and parties involved! As you can see, there are many filters and granular level cuts of data that can be explored in the final Tableau reports. Any stakeholder, client, or user can filter the data however they wanted, along business unit, demographiic filters, experience filters, first generation college status, and even the question type. 

The first visualization is a macro-level view that displayed the various reasons why people left the company, in an open-ended response manner.

The second visualization is a macro-level view that displayed the various reasons why people left the company, in a quantitative manner.
